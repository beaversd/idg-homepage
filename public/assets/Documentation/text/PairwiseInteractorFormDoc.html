    Along with TCRD tissue expression overlays, the IDG portal for Reactome allows users to overlay Pairwise relationships 
    from different sources onto pathways. When choosing pairwise relationship sets to overlay, users can pick different line colors for positive and 
    negative relationships. This way, users can more easily distinguish between interactions of each overlayed set. Users can overlay up to 6 sets of relationships at a time.
    Once a set of relationships is chosen, they are displayed on pathway diagrams as red decorators in the top right corner. The decorator has a number representing the total
    number of interactions for that diagram source. Clicking on this decorator will open a popup for visualizing all of the interactions. The pairwise relationship 
    popup can also be accessed from the functional interaction view by right clicking on a node and pressing the button next to the pin icon in the top right hand corner of the panel.
