<p>
    Drugs are overlayed by default on each pathway diagram. In the diagram view, complexes, entity sets, 
    and proteins with druggable targets have a purple decorator in the top left corner of the diagram object.
</p>

<p>
    Clicking on the Drug/Target decorator will open an IDG popup with present drugs for that diagram object.
    An example of this popup is visible in the next section. In the FIView visualizer, right clicking on the cytoscape 
    window presents an option to overlay drugs on the entire FI network.
