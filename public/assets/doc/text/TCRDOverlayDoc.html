The TCRD overlay feature allows users to display expression data from all 19 expression types represented in the TCRD
database. For each expression type, up to 12 tissues can be chosen to overlay at once. 
The overlay is visible on pathway diagrams and in the FI view.
After choosing a expression type and a set of tissues, one tissue can be overlayed at a time. The currently 
visible tissue can be changed using the control panel at the bottom of the page.
On the right side of the viewport, a legend allows users to visualize overlay values. TCRD overlay values are also
visible in the context panel for all diagram objects and functional interaction nodes. This allows for easy comparison
of values between tissues.
