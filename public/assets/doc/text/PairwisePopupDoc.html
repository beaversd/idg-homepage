    Pairwise Popups are split into a functional interaction view and a table of all of the exisiting pairwise relationships for a diagram source.
    The functional interaction view allows users to rearange nodes and visualize the relationships in a network. 
    By default, 5 positive and 5 negative interactions are added for each diagram source. TDark interactors will be shown preferentially by default.

<p>
    The table of pairwise relationships offers information about each relationship associated with a popup. The right most column contains a button allowing
    the user to add relationships to the diagram, or highlight them if they are already present. The table is filterable and paginated to improve the ability for 
    users to interact with the popup.

    The "Overlay Value" column displays the current value for each interactor. This value changes when users change the 
    current TCRD overlay or uses the TCRD overlay controls to change the tissue shown. By default, this column shows each interactor's Target Development Level.
