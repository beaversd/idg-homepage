    IDG Popups are split into a functional interaction view and a tab panel cotaining tables coresponding to the data displayed in the FI view.
    The functional interaction view allows users to rearange nodes and visualize the relationships in a network. There are currently two sets of data that can be displayed.
    Pairwise Interactions and Drug information can be displayed in the popup by clicking on their corresponding decorators in the diagram view, or by right clicking on a node in the FIView
    and then selecting the popup data you want to show.
</p>
<h3>Pairwise Interactions</h3>
<p>
    By default, 5 positive and 5 negative interactions are added for each diagram source. TDark interactors will be
    shown preferentially by default.
</p>
<p>
    The table of pairwise relationships offers information about each relationship associated with a popup. The right most column contains a button allowing
    the user to add relationships to the diagram, or highlight them if they are already present. The table is filterable and paginated to improve the ability for 
    users to interact with the popup. 
</p>
<p>
    The "Overlay Value" column displays the current value for each interactor. This value changes when users change the 
    current TCRD overlay or uses the TCRD overlay controls to change the tissue shown. By default, this column shows each interactor's Target Development Level.
</p>
<h3>Drug/Target Overlay</h3>
<p>
    Hexagon shaped nodes are overlayed on the FI network opened from the Diagram or FI visualizer. These hexagon shapes 
    represent drugs and their edges connect them to proteins they interact with. 
</p>
<p>
    The table of drug interactions contains a row for each edge represented between a drug and a protein. This table allows users to view a drug's activity value, activity type, and action type.
