<p>Nodes on this display can be dragged and separated by users. When hovered or selected, nodes display the name of the
gene represented, and its uniprot accession number. On right click, contextual information is displayed, and a link to
the genes uniprot page is made available to the user. These links open in a new tab.</p>

<p>Edges between nodes provide some information as well. When hovered or selected, each edge displays its target and
source genes as well as an annotation direction. The annotation direction is displayed by arrows and tee-bars on the
drawn edges as well as on hover, select, and context select popups. An arrow indicates when a gene activates the other.
Conversely, tee-bar indicates when a gene inhibits another. When an edge is right clicked, a context menu appears and
allows users to select which reactome source they want to be displayed for a given edge in the details pane and
hierarchy.</p>

    Right clicking on the background of the cytoscape display will provide options to change layout, overlay Drug/Target interactions
    onto the network, and search the network by gene name, uniprot, or drug name.
